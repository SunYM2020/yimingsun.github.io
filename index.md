Yiming Sun (孙一铭) has joined the Zhishan Postdoctoral Program (至善博士后) at Southeast University as an Assistant Professor (助理研究员). I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2024 and 2020. I received my B.S. degree from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2017. My supervisors were Prof. Qinghua Hu (胡清华) and Prof. Pengfei Zhu (朱鹏飞). I work closely with Assoc. Prof. Bing Cao (曹兵) at Tianjin University. My office is located in Room South-309, Li Wenzheng Building, Sipailou Campus, Southeast University, Nanjing. My research interests include **Multimodal Learning and UAV（Unmanned Aerial Vehicles）Vision**. 

## Research Interests

- **Multimodal Image Fusion**
- **Multimodal Object Detection**
- **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) Vision**
- **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) Embodied Intelligence**

### 低空智能实验室正在寻找自驱力较强的学生（硕士2026年秋季，博士2026秋季），与朱鹏飞教授共同指导，目标是在低空无人机智能感知与具身智能等课题上做出有影响力的工作。请随时通过电子邮件与我联系。
